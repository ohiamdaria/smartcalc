\section{Introduction}

Hi, this is an Implementation of SmartCalculator v1.0. GUI implementation, based on any GUI library with Qt, and the backend developed in C language
of C11 standard using gcc compiler. Application was developed on the MacOs Monterey with chip Apple M2

This application can perform Calculations of arbitrary arithmetic expressions in brackets 
in infix notation with the value of x replaced as a number

The application implements most of the trigonometric functions, several logarithmic functions, 
as well as all the mathematical operations 
usually available in each calculator. 

SmartCalculator provide plotting a graph of a function given by an expression in infix notation with the variable x.
The Application also has two special modes: "credit calculator" and "deposit profitability calculator"

\section{Functions and Operators}

The following mathematical operations and functions are implemented in the calculator:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Arithmetic operators
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Brackets -- "( )"
      \item Addition -- "a + b"
      \item Substraction -- "a - b"
      \item Multiplication -- "a * b"
      \item Division -- "a / b"
      \item Power -- "a \^\ b"
      \item Modulus -- "a mod b"
      \item Unary plus -- "+a"
      \item Unary minus -- "-a"
    \end{itemize}
    \item Functions
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $cos(x)$
      \item $sin(x)$
      \item $tan(x)$
      \item $acos(x)$
      \item $asin(x)$
      \item $atan(x)$
      \item $sqrt(x)$
      \item $ln(x)$
      \item $log(x)$
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\textit{These functions also are supported by the plotter.}

\section{Plotter/Grapher}

In this project, the Qcustomplot module is used.
Animation plotting of the function is supported.
It is possible to provide the user with the ability to change the scale
